# How to install multiple apps in Real Devices on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-php-multipleApps) using the Appium & PHP Language

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you might face a scenario where the APP1 that you are testing needs to interact with a few other applications APP2, APP3. In this scenario, LambdaTest offers an easy way out where you can just [upload your apps](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/appium-java/#upload-your-application) & add them to the multiple apps array.
It becomes extremely convenient now where you can just add those URLs & run your tests with ease. 

# Steps:

You can add the app URLs fetched by [uploading your apps](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/appium-java/#upload-your-application) in the ```otherApps``` capability.

Below is the ```AndroidApp.php``` example shown:

```
<?php
    require __dir__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
    use Facebook\WebDriver\Remote\DesiredCapabilities;
    use Facebook\WebDriver\Remote\RemoteWebDriver;
    use Facebook\WebDriver\WebDriverBy;

    $caps = array(
        "app"=>"lt://", //Enter app_url here
        "deviceName" => "Galaxy S20",
        "platformName" => "Android",
        "platformVersion" => "10",
        "isRealMobile" => TRUE,
        "visual" => TRUE,
        "video" => TRUE,
        "name" => "Php - Android test",
        "build" => "Php Vanilla - Android",

         // ADD THE APP URL OF OTHER APPS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO INSTALL ON THE SAME DEVICE

         "otherApps" => ["lt:// ", "lt:// "]  #ENTER THE OTHER APP URLs HERE IN AN ARRAY FORMAT

    );

    $username = getenv("LT_USERNAME") ? getenv("LT_USERNAME") : "username"; //Enter username here
    $accesskey = getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY") ? getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY") : "accesskey"; //Enter accesskey here

    $driver = RemoteWebDriver::create("https://$username:$accesskey@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub",$caps);

 try{
    $color_element = $driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::id('color'));
    $color_element->click();

    $text_element = $driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::id('Text'));
    $text_element->click();

    $toast_element = $driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::id('toast'));
    $toast_element->click();

    $notification_element = $driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::id('notification'));
    $notification_element->click();
    $driver->quit();

 } finally {
    $driver->quit();
 }

?>
```

### Executing The Tests

Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

```bash
php IOSApp.php
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>

```bash
php AndroidApp.php
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
